IMPLEMENTING C++ DECISION-MAKING STATEMENT AND LOOPS

This project demonstrates the usage of **decision-making statements** and **looping constructs** in C++ through simple examples.

## Objective
- Understand and implement decision-making statements (`if`, `if-else`, `switch`)
- Learn and use different loop structures (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Practice control flow logic in C++

## Topics Covered

### ✅ Decision-Making Statements
| Statement     | Purpose                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| `if`          | Executes code if condition is true |
| `if-else`     | Executes one block or another      |
| `else-if`     | Tests multiple conditions          |
| `switch`      | Selects one of many cases          |

### ✅ Looping Statements
| Loop Type     | Purpose                                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `for`         | Loop with a counter (fixed number of times)   |
| `while`       | Loop with a condition checked before execution|
| `do-while`    | Executes once, then checks the condition      |
